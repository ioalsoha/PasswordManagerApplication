Password Manager Application
---------------------------
The password manager application has been developed by Ibrahim Alsohaibani.

Pain Point
---------------------------
The pain point for the user is that the users have many passwords these days. The users can also easily forget their paswords and if they store their passwords to a notepad file in plain text, then there is a risk of forgetting the passwords.

Features
---------------------------
1. Login to a secure application (admin/password for test application)
2. Add passwords for different applications, e.g.
    laptop1 - pass123#
    gmail - man1u23
    db production - manu12222
3. The passwords are stored in encrypted format.
4. The user can see the applications for which passwords have been stored and can click on the application name to reveal password.
